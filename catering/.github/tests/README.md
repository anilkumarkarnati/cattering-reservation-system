# Testing Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains unit and integration tests for the Catering Reservation and Ordering System. The goal is to ensure all modules are testable, maintainable, and reliable.

## Test Approach
- **Unit tests** for each major module (auth, products, cart, orders, user-dashboard, etc.)
- **Integration tests** for workflows (e.g., user registration, order placement)
- **Manual test cases** for UI and end-to-end flows

## How to Run Tests
- (If using Jest or Mocha) Run `npm test` or `npx mocha` in the project root or functions directory.
- Manual tests: Follow the steps in each test case and verify expected outcomes in the UI and database.

## Sample Test Cases

### Auth Module
- Register with valid/invalid email and password
- Login with correct/incorrect credentials
- Logout and session expiration

### Products Module
- Add, update, delete product as admin
- View product as user

### Cart Module
- Add/remove items to/from cart
- Checkout with valid/invalid cart

### Orders Module
- Place order as user
- View order history
- Admin updates order status

### Logging
- All actions (login, CRUD, order) are logged in Firestore/log file
